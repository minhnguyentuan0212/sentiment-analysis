# Project Name
Word Embedding and Sentiment Analysis on VLSP dataset
## Description
After utilizing Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) for word embedding, I conducted sentiment analysis experiments employing CNN, LSTM, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. Subsequently, I refined these methods to enhance sentiment discernment.
## Features
- Implementation of Word2Vec with CRNN.
- Integration of CNNs and RNNs for advanced text analysis.
- Model performance comparisons and evaluations.
